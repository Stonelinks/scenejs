This directory contains examples that are liked from external sources like Chrome Experiments.

Filename changes are cool in other areas of the example set because those pages are linked via the examples
explorer, where you can update the explorer's index.json accordingly.

 Don't change filenames here because they are being linked directly to their files, eg.
